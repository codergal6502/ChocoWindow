## Introduction

ChocoWindow exists to make it easier for retro streamers to create backgrounds reminiscent of the windows used in the JRPGs of 8- and 16-bit platforms.

## Using ChocoWindow in your Projects

Download [`ChocoWindow.js`](ChocoWindow.js) and include it in your web page. You will have to supply your own spritesheet and corresponding `ChocoWinOption` definitions.
